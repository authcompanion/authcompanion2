## Introduction

AuthCompanion aims to satisfy the most common authentication and user management needs for your web application.

With AuthC you can:

- Securely handle the registration, login, logout, and account recovery of user accounts.
- Generate and validate [JWTs](https://jwt.io/introduction), a token used for your user's session and authenticating them into your web application's backend APIs
- Confidently store and own your web application's user accounts
- Support users registering and logining in with a passkey on their mobile device (aka passwordless) or with traditional username/passwords instead

---

## Features

- **Web Forms for User Authentication:** Use pre-built and customizable web
  forms for your application users to: log in with their credentials,
  register an account, update their profile, and issue forgotten passwords.

- **Manage User Profiles and JWTs:** Update the password and profile
  information of your users - all account information is stored in a SQLite
  database. Easily manage the life-cycle of your user's JWT used for
  authentication.

- **User Account Recovery:** Restore a user's access to their account using
  the **Forgot Password** flow which sends a special link via email for
  helping users quickly recover their account.

- **Extensible Platform:** AuthC supports a
  [plugin system](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/) for
  easily adding new functionality to cover more of your authentication needs.

- **Passwordless Flow:** Streamline user Login and Registration without passwords with a user's computer or mobile phone with passkey.
