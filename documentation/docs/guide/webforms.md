# Web Forms

AuthCompanion provides web forms for your application users to login, register
their accounts and trigger forgotten password flow.

These forms are built using [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and
[Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - making them easily customizable for
your specific branding and auth needs. What's great about these forms is that no
build step required to make changes to the web forms themselves; simply restart
AuthC to view your code changes. 👍
