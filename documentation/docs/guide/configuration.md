# Configure

AuthCompanion uses a configuration file - this config plays an important
function in setting up the server for production environments. If you're just
trying AuthC out - the default configuration will work just fine for development
(config file is optionally used).

To set the configuration, copy the exampe file as a `.env` file with your
settings.
