## Introduction

AuthCompanion aims to satisfy the most common authentication and user management needs for a web application.

With AuthC you can:

- Confidently store your web application's user accounts
- Securely handle the registration, login, logout, and account recovery of your applicaiton's users
- Generate and validate [JWTs](https://jwt.io/introduction), a token used for authenticating users into your application's backend APIs

---

## Features

- **Web Forms for User Authentication:** Use pre-built and customizable web
  forms for your application users to: log in with their credentials,
  register an account, update their profile, and issue forgotten passwords.

- **Manage User Profiles and JWTs:** Update the password and profile
  information of your users - all account information is stored in a SQLite
  database. Easily manage the life-cycle of your user's JWT used for
  authentication.

- **User Account Recovery:** Restore a user's access to their account using
  the **Forgot Password** flow which sends a special link via email for
  helping users quickly recover their account.

- **Extensible Platform:** AuthC supports a
  [plugin system](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Plugins/) for
  easily adding more functionality and covering more auth use cases.
